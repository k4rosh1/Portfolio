                        During my time as an elementary student at Shepherd's Flock School of Cabuyao, I experienced both academic and personal growth. The school provided a nurturing environment that fostered my love for learning. However, due to financial difficulties, I had to stop attending for a year. Despite this setback, the school's administration showed great compassion and understanding. When I asked to continue my studies, they welcomed me back, allowing me to resume my education without hesitation. This act of kindness deeply impacted me and further motivated me to pursue my studies with dedication and gratitude.

                        At the University of Cabuyao, I am currently a freshman in the Computer Science program, in section 1CS-B. It is great to be in the same class as friends from junior and senior high school. I chose Computer Science because I have some background knowledge about computers and a keen interest in the field. While the coursework is challenging, I enjoy the process and am excited to learn more in the coming years. The university has provided a supportive environment where I can deepen my understanding of computer science.
    
                        The faculty and resources available are instrumental in helping me navigate the complexities of the subject. Although the workload can be overwhelming, the encouragement from professors and classmates keeps me motivated. Being part of this program has allowed me to participate in group projects and collaborate with peers, enhancing my teamwork and problem-solving skills. I am eager to continue this journey, knowing that each challenge I overcome brings me closer to my goal of becoming proficient in computer science.            </div>
